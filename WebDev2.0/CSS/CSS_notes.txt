Cascading Style Sheet
the adjective of web pg
-is a language
Pattern for writing CSS:
        selector {
            property: value;
        }
can write inline style on HTML file | BAD PRACTICE! 
-can include <style> at top of html inside of head to put all styling.
Best practice - write css in css file then link page to html by using <link> in head of html
    <link rel='stylesheet' href="styleSheet.css"> //href will be location of style sheet.

COLORS: (monitors display 16 mil different colors)
    Named colors - colors with specific names ie - mediumorchid, teal, etc - 140 colors total
    RGB (red, green, blue), specify amount of r, g, and b - between o and 255
        rgb(0,0,255) = blue = blue | rgb(173,20,219) = purple
        more color = lighter color, less color = dark (255,255,255)= white while (0,0,0)=black
    Hexidecimal, is base 16. each spot can be 0-9 or A-F (10-15). starts with #, and there are 2 slots for R, G, and B. It is written as #RRGGBB
        #0f5679 = dark blue green | #5FCFFC = light blue = some red, more blue, most green
        -can also have 3 digit Hexidecimal- #000000 can be #000 (b/c pairs are same) | #CC55EE (pink) can be #C5E
    HSL is another color system (not explained)

TEXT: 
    text align - left, right, center
    font weight - boldness - can use bold, lighter OR numbers 700 = bold, 400 - normal
    text decoration - decorative line - strike through, underline, etc. can set line type or remove default line
    line height - changes line spacing, not text size
    letter spacing - space between letters
    font size - metrics vary
        small, medium, large
        PX - absolute - does not = 1 px - not good for responsive websites
    font family - changes font type - not all computers have fonts, so you can list back up fonts to use if computer doesnt have specific font  
        font-family: arial, calibri; //can also list a font family

SELECTORS 
    * universal selector - selects everything
    Element selector (img, h1, etc) - selects every tag. Can also be separated by commas
    # ID selector - selects based on ID
    . Class selector - selects group with same class name
    Descendant selector 
        ElementSelectorIsInside selectorYouWant {
            attribute: value;
        }
    Adjacent Selector 
        ElementBeforeSelector selectorYouWant {
            attribute: value; 
        }
    Direct Child Selector   
        parentElement childSelectorYouWant {
            attribute: value;
        }
    attribute selector
        all inputs where type equals text
        input[type="text"] {
            attribute: value; 
        }
        -can also use other syntax
        a[href*='example'] = href contains example
        a[href$='.org'] = href ending in .org
        a[class~="logo"] = a whos class contains the word logo 
    PSEUDO CLASSES - keywords added to a selector that specifies a special stat of the selected Element
        :active-something being active (like onClick)
        :checked-checkbox is checked
        :first
        :first-child
        :hover-mouse is hovering
        :not()
        :nth-of-child()
        :nth-of-type() - every certain # (ie, every 3rd) or a specific#
            nth-of-type(3) 3rd
            nth-of-type(3n) every 3rd
        
        a:hover { //when achor tag is hovered over
            color:orange;
        }
    PSEUDO ELEMENT - keyworded added to selector that lets you style a particular part of selected Elements. Use :: to indicate pseudo element. ** if there's a beaker/flask icon next to element on MDN pg, it means it is experimental and shouldn't be used on production code.
        ::after
        ::before
        ::first-letter
        ::first-line 
        ::selection - any part of element which is highlighted by user
    The Cascade - the order your style and links are declared MATTERS!!! IE - declare icon link first, then css pg to ensure you can style the icons. 
specificity - the more specific the selector the higher the weight for the CSS, when there are competing styles. IE - two background colors applied with one selecting element and the other using class. Class is more specific and will be used for styling.
